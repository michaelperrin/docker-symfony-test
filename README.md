Symfony Docker quick test
=========================

A quick test to show how Symfony is slow using Docker / Docker beta (yup, the one that
leverages OS X virtualization technology) on OS X.

This is due to the volume share. Using Symfony in a container without sharing volume is very fast (~20ms in dev mode).

## Install

    docker build -t sf-test .
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`:/var/www/symfony_project --name symfony_docker_test sf-test

Make sure that Composer is done running and that the server is started:

    docker logs -f symfony_docker_test

## Have a look at Symfony's default homepage

Open in your browser the following URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


## Results

The example is much faster on the `master` branch since I moved the `cache`, `logs` and `vendor` (biggest win with this one) directories outside of the shared directory.
You can switch to the `non-shared-vendor` branch to make tests with `cache`, `logs` and `vendor` dirs in the shared volume (which is the default Symfony install).

Benchmarks results from this command in Symfony `prod` environment:

    ab -n 100 -r 127.0.0.1:8080

 or:

    ab -n 100 -r http://127.0.0.1:8080/
